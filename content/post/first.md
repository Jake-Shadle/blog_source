title: Trying out this blogging thing
type: post
---

Though I have enjoyed reading coding blogs for years now, I have never thought seriously about doing my own, most
probably because the main language I use is **C++**, which doesn't really inspire me, to say the least.

However, I *have* been inspired by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) for about a year or so now (and still going
strong!). While it has been more than a year since [1.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html), there is
a still a huge amount of stuff that is improving on a daily basis, and as
[this blog post](http://mgattozzi.github.io/2016/09/27/blog-about-rust.html) points out, Rust needs more content of all
types.

I thought maybe this blog could be one way I could help the Rust community. Not only because they are a lovely bunch of
people, but also because I want to increase that community to include more and more C++ programmers so that the balance
eventually tips over and they start using Rust as their default language of choice when starting new projects or rewriting
old ones.

Also when I attended [RustFest](http://www.rustfest.eu/) I was struck by this quote from
[Ashley Williams](https://twitter.com/ag_dubs) in her [talk](https://intermezzos.github.io/rustfest2016).

> teaching is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is

This is something I have thought about before, but it definitely reminded me that I absolutely learn a lot more when I
want to relay information to a wider audience (mostly to reduce my chances of looking like a dumbass).

So in conclusion, I guess I am writing this because I am selfish and want to use a nicer language when possible, as well
as improve myself, and my evil master plan is to write nice (and hopefully helpful) stuff about Rust. (I will try to
keep **C++** snark to a minimum, but I have used the language for so long now, I think I deserve some leeway)

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Internetz");
}
```
